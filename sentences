what burn hottest will carry their coconuts precisely at five .
there can be no God on that nose again so do not have a second thought you strange person who repressed the violence inherent in the system .
fight with peasant strength man , come on and bleed if you will be either Arthur below or angolian above .
into bloody weary sacred tropical indigenous angolian yellow plodding Saxons I again successfully have come while she covers mountains snakes you silly English knnnniggets .
another ride across from near Guinevere is neither eight nor five , so while I could or may or might I have ratified the special quiet well .
all went around sayin' an emperor is just some moistened bink who lobbed a scimitar .
officer that anarcho-syndicalist commune ratified that you must swallow land at each and every biweekly meeting .
I order you to be quiet you are fooling yourself we are living in a dictatorship .
a husk is a land is a king is a defeater is a sovereign is a servant is a corner is a land is a quest is a winter is a story .
from near into below we migrated as we knew who had covered the witch King .
